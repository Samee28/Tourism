        <P>Chowmahalla Palace or Chowmahallat is the palace of the Nizams of Hyderabad State located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.[1] It was the seat of power of the Asaf Jahi dynasty (1720-1948) and was the official residence of the Nizams of Hyderabad during their reign. Presently the palace is converted into a museum but the ownership still lies with the family.[2]

            The palaces is constructed at the location of an earlier existing palaces of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty and Asaf Jahi Dynasty[2] close to the Charminar. Construction of the palace as it stands today was started by Nizam Ali Khan Asaf Jah II[3] in 1769. He ordered to build four palace from which the nomenclature of Chau Mahalla was acquired.[4] The word chār or chahār, and its variation chow, means "four" and the word mahal means "palace" in Urdu, Hindi and Persian.[</P>

       <P>While Salabat Jung initiated its construction in 1750, it was completed by the period of Afzal ad-Dawlah, Asaf Jah V between 1857 and 1869.[6][7]

        The palace is unique for its style and elegance. Construction of the palace began in the late 18th century and over the decades a synthesis of many architectural styles and influences emerged. The palace consists of two courtyards as well as the grand Khilwat (the Darbar Hall), fountains and gardens.[8] The palace originally covered 45 acres (180,000 m2), but only 12 acres (49,000 m2) remain today.[9]</P>>

        Northern courtyard
        This part has Bara Imam, a long corridor of rooms on the east side facing the central fountain and pool that once housed the administrative wing and Shishe-Alat, meaning mirror image.
        
        It has Mughal domes and arches and many Persian elements like the ornate stucco work that adorn the Khilwat Mubarak. These were characteristics of buildings built in Hyderabad at the time.
        
        Opposite the Bara Imam is a building that is its shishe or mirror image. The rooms were once used as guest rooms for officials accompanying visiting dignitaries.

        Khilwat Mubarak
        This is heart of Chowmahalla Palace. It is held in high esteem by the people of Hyderabad, as it was the seat of the Asaf Jahi dynasty. The grand pillared Durbar Hall has a pure marble platform on which the Takht-e-Nishan or the royal seat was laid. Here the Nizams held their durbar and other religious and symbolic ceremonies.[10] The 19 spectacular Chandeliers of Belgian crystal were recently reinstalled to recreate the lost splendor of this regal hall.

        Roshan Bangla
        The Sixth Nizam, Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, is believed to have lived here and the building was named after his mother Roshan Begum.
        
        The present Nizam (Barkat Ali Khan Mukarram Jah) and his family decided to restore the Chowmahalla Palace and open it to the public in January 2005. It took over 5 years to document and restore the palaces of the first courtyard to its former glory. The palace also has a collection of vintage cars, including the Rolls-Royce, which were used by the Nizam Kings.</P>
