        Makkah Masjid
        
        Makkah Masjid or Mecca Masjid, is a congregational mosque in Hyderabad, India. It is the largest mosque in the city,[2] and one of the largest mosques in the country, with a capacity of 10,000 people.[3] The mosque was built during the 17th century, and is a state-protected monument. It serves as the primary mosque for the Old City of Hyderabad,[4] and is located close to the historic landmarks of Charminar, Chowmahalla Palace and Laad Bazaar.</P>

        <P>The construction of the Makkah Masjid began in the year 1617 CE, during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Qutb Shah, the sixth Qutb Shahi Sultan of Golconda (now Hyderabad). The ruler personally laid its foundation stone. Around 8,000 workers were employed to build the mosque. It was completed by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1693.[6][3] The three arched facades[dubious â€“ discuss] have been carved from a single piece of granite, which took five years to quarry.</P>

        <P>Built with local granite, it finds place among largest mosques in India and is the most important and largest one in the city. The arched gallery displays the tombs of all the Nizam's from the year 1803. The mosque has a length of 225 feet and is 180 feet wide with a height of 75 feet. The name is derived from the Grand Mosque in Mecca on which it is modeled. The hall has a dimension of 67 metres x 54 metres x 23 metres. The roof is rested on 15 arches.

            There is a high blocking wall on the western side for Mehrab. It has two huge octagonal columns, which are created from a single piece of granite. This is inturn topped by an arched gallery crowned by a dome. This mosque can accommodate 10,000 worshipers at any time. It is located two hundred yards from Charminar. The mosque was believed to have used bricks during its construction where brought from Mecca. A room in the courtyard is believed to house a sacred relic of the prophet.
            
            According to history, Sultan Muhammad Qutub Shah invited the entire devout religious elders in the city to lay the foundation stone but as no one had come forward, Sultan Muhammad himself volunteered to lay foundation and it is said that he never missed his midnight prayer in life right from the age of 12. Visitors coming to Charminar also visit the holy mosque, which lends a divine aura to the Muslim worshippers in the old city of Hyderabad.</P>
        <P>Architecture
            The Mecca Masjid is considered to be one of the best architectural works of the Qutb Shahis.[10] It is constructed entirely of dressed stone, rather than rubble or plaster. The mosque's prayer hall measures 225 feet (69 m) by 180 feet (55 m), and has a 75 feet (23 m) high ceiling. The facade of the prayer hall features five open arches, and is flanked by two minarets. Each minaret is topped by a dome, and adjoined to an arcaded balcony lining either side of the prayer hall.
            
            The sahn (courtyard) of the mosque measures 108 square metres.[4] It contains a sundial, as well as the remains of a hammam. Two minarets lie on either side of the main entrance to the mosque complex.[</P>
